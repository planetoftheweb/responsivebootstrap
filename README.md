Find out how Bootstrap can transform your standard HTML websites into inspired single-page designs.

Plus, learn how to track navigation as users scroll, with the ScrollSpy plugin, and create a full-screen, responsive image carousel.

## Topics include:
- Analyzing your markup
- Creating simple column layouts
- Creating basic navigation and a simple carousel
